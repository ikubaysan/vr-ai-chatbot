Install VB-CABLE A+B from here:
https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm

Neos: Set out of whisper voice bubble to 0%. Use a whisper bubble.

Head Proxy -> AvatarAudioOutputManager
Under WhisperConfig, copy NormalConfig values. This will adjust who can hear the bot, while what it can hear will still be limited by the whisper bubble.
